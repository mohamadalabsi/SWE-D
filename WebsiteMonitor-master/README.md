The system allows users to register for updates on a specific website. Upon
registration, users provide the URL of the website they wish to monitor and specify
their notification preferences, such as frequency and preferred communication

user via their chosen communication channel. Users can also manage their website
subscriptions, allowing them to modify or cancel existing subscriptions as needed.
